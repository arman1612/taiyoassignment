This is a contact management app built with ReactJS, TailwindCSS, React Router v6 and React Query, which also includes a dashboard with charts and maps showing COVID-19 data.

## Objective

The app has two main objectives:

1.  Contact Management: The app allows users to add, view, edit, and delete contacts. Contacts are stored in Redux, and the app uses React Query to handle API calls and data management.

2.  Charts and Maps Dashboard: The app includes a dashboard with a line graph showing the fluctuations in COVID-19 cases and a React Leaflet map with markers showing the country name, total number of active, recovered cases, and deaths in that particular country.

## APIs Used

The following APIs were used to fetch data for the dashboard:

- World-wide data of cases: https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all
- Country-specific data of cases: https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries
- Graph data for cases with date: https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/historical/all?lastdays=all

1.  Clone the GitHub repo to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3.  Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
